## ⚠️ Warning
This extension is now discontinued and this repo archived since Instagram started to roll out the dark mode natively. Thank you for your support and for using my extension.

## 📷 Native Instagram Dark Mode

This extension enables the hidden Instagram dark mode by simply adding a parameter to the URL.

## 🤔 How it works

Instagram has a complete hidden dark mode that you can enable by adding `?theme=dark` at the end of the URL. It works fine until you click in a link inside Instagram and refresh the page. This extension solves it by listening to every new URL request and adding that parameter to the URL, maintaining the dark mode.
